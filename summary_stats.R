p("The data that we are working with are 8 data sets (2010-2017) from the National 
  Highway Traffic Safety Administrations (NHTSA). These tell us the number of 
  people killed in fatal car crashes based on age group and US state.")

p("Our mission for our data that we report is to give insight to people who may be
  affected by vehicle laws in their state. We hope that this information plays as a
  determining factor on whether residents stay in/move to a certain state or not, 
  especially families. Also, we hope that legislators and lawmakers make use of our
  data for evidence to improve vehicle laws in their representing area.")

Map
"To utilize this map plot, first choose the year you are interested in and then choose 
an age group. Now, you will be able to see a the U.S. states color coded by how many 
fatalities they had for that age group in that year. Light yellow indicates a low 
fatality number and the darker the state, the higher the fatalities. This can be 
important to use if you want to see the most dangerous places for a specific age group."

Bar graph
"To utilize this bar graph, first choose the year you are interested in and the state. 
In the bar graph you will see the number of car crash deaths in the state for each age 
group of the year. A red colored bar indicates that the number is above the national 
average while the green colored bar indicates that it's below average. This can be 
important to use to find out which age groups suffer the most deaths from car crashes."

Line graph
"To utitlize this line graph, first choose the state you are interested in and the age 
group. In the line graph, you will see how the number of fatalities progress throughout 
the years. This can be important to use to find out whether a state's fatality rate is 
improving or getting worse as time goes by for the selected age group."
