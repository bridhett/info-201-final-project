The data that we are working with are 8 data sets (2010-2017) from the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administrations (NHTSA). These tell us the number of people killed in
fatal car crashes based on age group and US state. Our mission for our data that
we report is to give insight to people who may be affected by vehicle laws in their
state. We hope that this information plays as a determining factor on whether
residents stay in/move to a certain state or not, especially families.
Also, we hope that legislators and lawmakers make use of our data for evidence
to improve vehicle laws in their representing area.
